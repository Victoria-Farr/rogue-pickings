# Rogue Pickings site

A clean, minimalist site for a "fresh food" restaurant truck business, complete with information about locations, menus, and reviews from satisfied customers! It was crafted using our good ole' friends HTML & CSS from a comp provided by a web designer.

## Prerequisites

- A simple, up-to-date browser than can read and display HTML5 & CSS is all that's needed. 🤓

This is a student project for display only, thanks!
